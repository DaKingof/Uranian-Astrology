# Uranian Astrology Dial Implementation Update

## Fixed Issues

This update addresses two key issues with the previous dial implementation:

1. **Fixed Reversed Mouse Movement**
   - The dial now moves in the expected direction: when you move your mouse counterclockwise, the dial moves counterclockwise
   - This was fixed by changing the angle difference calculation in the drag handling method

2. **Fixed Position Reading**
   - The position reading now correctly matches the outer markings
   - If the red arm points to 330°, it now correctly displays 330° (not 30°)
   - This was fixed by using a negative rotation angle for inner elements

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Drag Handling

The drag handling logic was modified to reverse the direction:

```rust
// FIXED: Reversed the order to match the expected direction
let mut angle_diff = start_angle - current_angle;

// FIXED: Changed to addition to match expected direction
let new_angle = self.drag_start_angle + angle_diff;
```

### 2. Inner Dial Elements Rotation

The inner tick marks and arms now use a negative angle to ensure the position reading matches the outer markings:

```rust
// Get current rotation angle - FIXED: Now uses negative to match clockwise direction
let current_degree = -self.current_position.to_degrees();
```

### 3. Arrow Key Behavior

Fixed the arrow key behavior to match the expected directions:

```rust
match key {
    egui::Key::ArrowLeft => {
        // Counterclockwise movement (increasing angle)
        let new_degrees = self.current_position.to_degrees() + increment;
        self.current_position = DegreePosition::from_degrees(new_degrees);
    }
    egui::Key::ArrowRight => {
        // Clockwise movement (decreasing angle)
        let new_degrees = self.current_position.to_degrees() - increment;
        self.current_position = DegreePosition::from_degrees(new_degrees);
    }
    _ => {}
}
```

## Interaction Model

The dial now behaves as expected:

1. **Clicking**: Clicking on the dial does not move it
2. **Dragging**: Dragging moves the dial in the direction of mouse movement
   - Moving the mouse counterclockwise moves the dial counterclockwise
   - Moving the mouse clockwise moves the dial clockwise
3. **Position Reading**: The position reading correctly matches the outer markings
   - When the red arm points to 30°, it displays 30°
   - When the red arm points to 330°, it displays 330°
4. **Arrow Keys**: 
   - Left arrow moves the dial counterclockwise
   - Right arrow moves the dial clockwise

These changes ensure a more intuitive and precise dial experience, making it easier to position the dial exactly where you want it.
