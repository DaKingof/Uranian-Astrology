# Uranian Astrology Dial Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the dial feature in the Uranian Astrology application.

## Overview

The dial feature has been implemented with proper modularization, following a clean architecture approach. The code is now organized into logical modules, making it easier to maintain and extend.

## Key Components

### `astrology/angle.rs`

The `DegreePosition` struct represents an angular position in degrees, minutes, and seconds. It provides methods to:

- Create positions from degrees, radians, or individual components
- Convert positions to degrees or radians
- Format positions as strings (e.g., "123°45'12"")
- Perform arithmetic operations (add, subtract, interpolate)

### `astrology/harmonics.rs`

The `Harmonic` enum provides type-safe representation of different harmonic settings:

- First (360°)
- Second (180°)
- Fourth (90°)
- Eighth (45°)
- Sixteenth (22.5°)
- Custom (any value)

It includes methods to calculate arm counts, angle spans, and display names for each harmonic.

### `ui/dial.rs`

The `Dial` widget handles rendering and interaction with the dial. It includes:

- Drawing the circular dial with proper tick marks
- Rendering the arms based on the selected harmonic
- Drawing the arrow pointer that spans exactly 2 degrees
- Handling mouse and keyboard interactions
- Providing precise control with modifier keys:
  - Shift: 1 degree increments
  - Ctrl: 1 minute increments
  - Shift+Ctrl: 1 second increments

### `ui/controls.rs`

The `DialControls` component provides UI controls for the dial, including:

- Harmonic selection
- Position display
- Controls help text

### `utils/math.rs`

Utility functions for mathematical operations:

- Normalizing angles in degrees or radians
- Converting between degrees and radians
- Calculating angular differences

## Implementation Notes

- The dial now correctly shows 0° at the top with numbers increasing as you go left (counterclockwise)
- The arrow pointer spans exactly 2 degrees as specified
- The number of arms adjusts based on the selected harmonic
- The position is displayed in degrees/minutes/seconds format, showing seconds only when non-zero
- Modifier keys provide precise control over the angle selection

## Future Considerations

For the planned migration to Qt6/QML:

- The core calculation logic (in the `astrology` module) is independent of the UI framework
- Clean interfaces between components will facilitate the migration
- The modular structure provides a solid foundation for future development

## Conclusion

The implemented dial feature meets all the specified requirements while establishing a well-structured codebase that will be easier to maintain and extend. The modular design ensures that future updates, including the planned migration to Qt6/QML, can be implemented with minimal changes to the core logic.
